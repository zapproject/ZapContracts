# Contributing

Help is always appreciated!

In order to contribute it may be useful to... 

  * Be well-versed at writing smart-contracts in Solidity.
  * Have a strong understanding of Node and ethjs.
  * Be familiar with the ZAP Data Flow Diagram (at the bottom of README.md)

In particular, we need help in the following areas:

  * [NatSpec Documentation](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Natural-Specification-Format) 
  for all contracts and functions, especially `@notice` tags for public and external methods (use of [dynamic 
  expressions](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Natural-Specification-Format#dynamic-expressions) 
  is encouraged)
  
  
## How to Report Issues  

To report an issue, please use the
[issues tracker](https://github.com/zapproject/ZapContracts/issues). When
reporting issues, please mention the following details:

* Which version of Solidity you are using
* What was the source code (if applicable)
* Which platform are you running on
* How to reproduce the issue
* What was the result of the issue
* What the expected behaviour is

Providing a [Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) 
is always very helpful and sometimes even clarifies a misunderstanding.

## Pull Requests

In order to contribute, please fork off of the ``develop`` branch and make your
changes there. Your commit messages should detail *why* you made your change
in addition to *what* you did (unless it is a tiny change).

Also, please make sure to follow the project coding standards from the [Google JS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html) and the [Solidity Style Guide](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/style-guide.html).

Thanks for the help!
